As the facilities grew, so too did the program, and in 2015 we established our year-round Artist Residency. In the intervening decade, the program has flourished, and hosted hundreds of artists from a wide range of disciplines. Our hope is to foster an environment of creative urgency and intensity of purpose, in which people are free to (inter)act, and from which new works and ideas may emerge. We welcome artists and thinkers from all disciplines to inhabit our spaces and pursue their questions, both individually and in collaboration. The residency seeks to offer creative sanctuary, giving residents the freedom to shape their workspace and working rhythms within the historic Faith Mills Complex in rural Upstate New York. It also presents an opportunity to develop potential emergent relationships with fellow residents, and the broader local community. A warm Victorian home; a big white barn; textile mills turned studio space, and an old country Inn, surrounded by woods and lakes and buzzing with shared dinners and bonfire conversations, await your practice. We are situated within an enthusiastic community that is highly active in the programming of Arts Letters & Numbers, including visiting artists, community events, open studios, workshops, exhibitions, and youth internships that run parallel to and interweave with the Residency Program. As an Artist in Residence, you will be invited to participate in and host some of these features, as well as to propose your own projects to foster and enrich the community dialogue, (i.e. lectures, exhibitions, performances, etc.), as and where you feel comfortable. Foundational to Arts Letters & Numbers is that it is constructed by and between all of us: not just those who are directly involved in its day to day operation, but all of our participants, visitors, and local community members. As a resident and member of our community, we expect you will lend yourself to the greater project by caring for yourself and our spaces, while holding an openness to the diversity of our community. As part of the application process, applicants are asked to select their preferred living arrangement. We offer private or shared rooms in one of three available living spaces: The House on the Hill, The Twins, or The Inn. For detailed information about each, please visit our Spaces page.

Accommodations At our artist residency, we offer three distinct accommodation options to suit various preferences, ensuring that every artist finds a living arrangement that meets their needs. 1. House on the Hill: Centrally located on our campus, this option offers both single and shared rooms, making it ideal for those who thrive in a collaborative environment and prefer to be at the heart of campus activities. The house offers full living comforts, including access to cooking and laundry facilities. 2. The Twins: Just across the street from the House on the Hill, The Twins offer single and shared rooms within individual apartments, providing a bit more privacy. This option is perfect for artists who seek a balance between social interaction and personal space. The Twins also offer full living comforts, with access to kitchen and laundry facilities. 3. The Inn: For maximum privacy, The Inn offers single and shared rooms just a minute’s drive or a ten-minute walk from the main campus. This proximity ensures easy access to studios and communal spaces while providing a quiet environment for your stay. Although The Inn operates more like a hotel, with no on-site cooking facilities, residents can utilize the kitchens on the main campus. Additionally, guests staying at The Inn will receive a $50 weekly voucher to ALN's La Perla Restaurant (voted "Best New Restaurant in the Capital District" in 2001), adding a delightful Italian dining experience to their stay. Each accommodation option is an integral part of our campus, strategically positioned to support a productive and dynamic environment. Whether you choose the central location of the House on the Hill, the balanced privacy of The Twins, or the relative seclusion of The Inn, you will have access to all the resources and opportunities our residency offers. Our aim is to provide living arrangements that enhance the creative process and contribute to a fulfilling residency experience. Studio / Workspace Arts Letters & Numbers facilities are a collection of buildings once part of the former textile complex Faith Mills along Burden Lake Road in Averill Park, NY: the House on the Hill, the Twins, the Barn , the Studios and the Shop . With a variety of different sized studio spaces (socially distanced areas in both large and smaller rooms), a wooden barn and the outdoor grounds , we welcome artists to think of these spaces at sites they can work with and within. We'll help you choose one that best suits your practice. The Shop is equipped with basic woodworking tools and an assortment of power and hand tools. Additional equipment are digital media, musical instruments including a 9’ concert grand piano, a 5’ baby grand and upright piano all available for artists to use. Expectations Towards the Artist Artists are expected to pursue their individual creative endeavor and many times this calls for leading a workshop, giving a lecture, sharing a film, partake in critique, exhibiting/performing work etc. These are optional but has proven to be an integral tool for artists to find inspiration and to allow others to experience the works in progress or previous works. The artist will be encouraged to propose any form of sharing suitable for their work. Everyone staying at Arts Letters & Numbers is expected to treat the facilities with care and consideration as well as be mindful of each other’s space. Whether it’s in a living or working situation, everyone is responsible to clean up after themselves, and to lend a helping hand when needed. Arts Letters & Numbers is based on the value and reward derived from communal efforts. Staying at ALN you will become part of an ecosystem. During this time you will be asked to follow the guidelines provided, and respect the integrity of the spaces, property and personal spaces.
