EXHIBITION DESCRIPTION In a world increasingly shaped by political unrest, censorship, and global crises, artists are often confronted with a critical question: What is my responsibility in the face of conflict? Must art speak truth to power—or is silence also a choice? “Drawing Resistance: The Artist’s Dilemma in Political Conflict” is a virtual group exhibition that explores the tensions artists face when navigating their creative practice in politically charged environments. The title plays on the dual meaning of “drawing”—as both a visual act and a metaphor for tracing boundaries, beliefs, or courage. We invite women and non-binary artists from around the world to submit work that confronts, reflects on, or challenges political realities—whether global or deeply personal. Submissions may explore war, migration, censorship, social justice, protest, surveillance, gender-based oppression, or the quiet defiance of everyday survival. We are especially interested in works that wrestle with the dilemma of making art in a time of unrest: how to act, what to say, and what it means to resist. This virtual exhibition welcomes all mediums , including but not limited to: painting, drawing, collage, printmaking, photography, sculpture (documented virtually), digital art, video, performance (video or audio), and written word (poetry, short text, or manifesto). Artists may submit up to three works per entry . All submissions must clearly relate to the exhibition theme. WMG's Program Committee will select the works which will be presented in an online gallery alongside artist statements to offer context and deepen audience engagement. Please include a short artist statement (100–250 words) for each work submitted. Your statement should explain how your piece relates to the exhibition theme of political conflict, resistance, or the artist’s role in times of unrest. Share what inspired the work and how you see it engaging with activism, dissent, or personal/political struggle. The statement will appear alongside your work in the virtual exhibition to provide context and deepen viewer understanding. This virtual exhibition is open to artwork in all media that has not been previously exhibited at WMG.
