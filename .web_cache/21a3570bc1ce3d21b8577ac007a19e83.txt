Exhibition Opportunity | Promoted The Signal. The Noise. - London Open Call Updated: 19 June 2025 Take part in Pai32’s Summer Show. We seek local and international artists in any medium—traditional or experimental. Exhibition Concept:  “We came looking for meaning. We found distortion instead.” In an age of endless messages, blurred truths, and constant noise, how do we really connect? The Signal. The Noise. is an exhibition exploring the chaotic, fragmented landscape of communication in the digital era. It reflects on what happens when clarity collapses, when messages glitch, and when interference becomes the message itself. Eligibility: Artists aged 18+ worldwide. We welcome painting, print, sculpture, photography, digital or video art, interactive pieces, drawings and site-specific installations. What You Get: Exhibit in a central London gallery with a discerning audience, meet curators, collectors and fellow artists, sell your work and grow your collector base, and—if you cannot attend—submit high-resolution files for museum-quality printing. Participation marks a prestigious milestone for any emerging or mid-career artist.
