Apply now for a residency book a virtual visit of the Scuola Feedback from our Alumni I can't quite put into words how valuable my residency at the Scuola has been. 

I was excited to try printmaking and thought it might be exciting to experiment, but WOW! What a revelation! 

I had no idea that, with Alessia's generous and expert guidance, making prints would reveal a whole way for me to grow my work and discover new ways of creating. I have no doubt that when I return to my New York studio, my transformative experience at the Scuola will also open up new directions in my practice. It was exactly the refresh that my work needed!

I am so grateful to Lorenzo, Matilde, Alessia, and Kate for providing me with this opportunity, not least because I now feel that in addition to new ways of working, I have a new community of friends in Venice üôÇ

Alla prossima! Jane South Chair, Fine Arts, Pratt Institute (NY - USA) ‚ÄúThe Scuola is a well-established institution offering a congenial atmosphere to develop one‚Äôs artistic practice. Developed and managed by Venetian artists, the Scuola is a unique artist residency in the center of Venice and, in my opinion, the best in the city. The facilities are well maintained and the atmosphere is friendly and supportive. Among the residencies that I have attended around the world, I would consider the Scuola to be one of the best. I plan to return and to recommend the Scuola to my colleagues." Anne Bush University of Hawaii (USA) ‚Äú‚ÄúI had a wonderful and very productive time. I had the freedom to follow my own path without intrusion or expectation. Any support i required or needed was available at any time. The print studio had the warmth of a space where printmaking is cherished, respected and loved. The fellow resident artist‚Äôs added to the experience with great camaraderie, care and fun.‚Äù Jeoffrey Ricardo Australia ‚ÄúMy time at the Scuola was excellent! I felt welcomed by all the people at the Scuola, from the directors to the other resident artists‚Ä¶everyone was very generous and enjoyed each others company. I made a lot of friends and enjoyed minute there. It really helps to come prepared and with a strong idea of what you want to make or want to learn. The facilities there are very good and one can make most any type of print. The location of the Scuola is perfectly situated in one of the best spots in Venice. I can‚Äôt wait to go back!‚Äù Christopher Ganz Purdue University, Fort Wayne (USA) ‚ÄúVery difficult to pinpoint ‚Äòthe most memorable part‚Äô of my residency at the Scuola for it was all truly memorable. My four weeks there were fantastic! I was delighted in being assisted to discover new ways of making prints and extend my art practice. The crowning glory was to see the powerful work of Maria Lai in the Scuola‚Äôs gallery (as part of the Biennale), in the days before I returned home to Australia. .‚Äù Dr. Annette Iggulden Deakin University (Australia) ‚ÄúI had been to Venice five times before. Then I decided to print directly at the ScuoIa and was so very happy to find such a good studio especially with very friendly people. I appreciated the very well endowed workshop and Mathilde‚Äôs knowledge of every printing technique. My favorite was the old print stamper from 1870.‚Äù Katrin Magens Germany ‚ÄúI loved being part of the skilled, artistic personnel of the Scuola in the most inspirational environment of the world ‚Äì Venezia! My residency consisted of three calligraphic parts; teaching uncials, having an exhibition and my own art project ‚ÄòGo with Letters‚Äô which offers the Venezia visitors a peek into the role of calligraphy in the visual culture of the city.‚Äù Vuokko Koho Finland ‚ÄúThe Scuola has a leader, and a staff, with a passion and vision for the print, for the shared ideas of the artists who come to participate. As a mature artist it can be difficult to step out of the daily habits of the home studio and find new territory, new inspiration, and mentorship. I found all of that in Venice at the Scuola, and much more. Friendship, dialogue, and the opportunity to experience Venice not as a tourist, but as a member of the artistic community.‚Äù Elizabeth Brinton USA ‚ÄúThe residencies (Summer and Winter) have given me the opportunity to work alongside artists from all over the world in a location that has so much to offer. The connections I have made at the Scuola have changed the direction of my art for the better.‚Äù Cate McCammon USA ‚ÄúThe Scuola is one of Venice‚Äôs hidden gems with its historic setting, excellent facilities and professional staff. It was quite memorable to be working and living in an area rich in heritage. The facilities were far superior to other residencies I have attended. The workshop was always kept in a professional and immaculate condition with a variety of equipment and materials readily available.‚Äù Greg Mallyon Australia Venice Artist Residency Supported Techniques At the Scuola‚Äôs Printmaking Studio, artists can work on 8 etching presses, a vertical press for woodcut, a typographic press for letterpress.
