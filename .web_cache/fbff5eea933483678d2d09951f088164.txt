Exhibition Opportunity Singularity Exhibition Open Call Updated: 19 June 2025 The MSU Museum’s CoLab Studio invites global submissions for Singularity, an exhibition exploring the impacts of artificial intelligence surpassing human intelligence. We welcome bold, interdisciplinary ideas—artworks, research, games, performances, and more—that imagine utopian or dystopian futures shaped by AI. Themes include ethics, identity, creativity, consciousness, and democracy. Eligibility: This open call is extended to everyone, from every level of experience and discipline including students. Submissions from individuals or groups working locally or internationally in fields related to computer or data science, communications, human-computer interaction, art, psychology, biology, music, or a diverse combination of fields and beyond are welcomed. Proposals can be for an existing exhibit or an idea in development, such as a new or existing artwork, digital intervention, research project, a virtual game, a series of visualizations, or something else. What you get: Selected projects will receive funding of up to $3,000 to support production costs, shipping, and other expenses. Submissions must include a draft budget as part of the application process.
