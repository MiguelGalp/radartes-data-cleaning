In this second edition, we're planning a seaside trip along the coast of the Black Sea. We're going to make a 7-day road trip starting from the south and moving north. We'll go camping a bit, we'll do short hikes, we'll dip in healing mud baths, stroll in the old seaside towns, go canoeing, or who knows what more... So, swimming would be a nice skill if you'd like to join! Mosquitos are to be considered! The road trip will end at Nopoint for an 8-day intense printing session and everyone will develop their silkscreen and/or riso project. Travelling will be with our van - yes, the same old one that we did the Risonate trip with. But instead of travelling with the Riso as a companion, we’re going to take aboard 3 artists.
