The residency period is planned to be between 1 September and 1 December 2025. The residency duration will be at least 30 days and a maximum of 90 days. Artists will collaborate with young creators, local students, or emerging art teams. This initiative aims to cultivate the curatorial practice, artistic execution, and social observation skills of a new generation of creators, fostering intergenerational legacy and inspiration. International artists selected for the residency in Taipei will participate in the following four activity components: local cultural tours, workshop experience camps, on-site creation, and an exhibition for final presentation. Based on the themes derived from the cultural tours, they must complete at least one on-site creation. Individual artists aged 20 to 45, specialising in flat painting, graffiti art, mural art, or related cross-disciplinary fields, are welcome to apply. Up to eight international artists (i.e., artists from outside Taiwan) will be selected. This programme primarily supports individual artists; teams, spouses, or relatives are not covered. This programme provides international artists with round-trip economy class airfare and transportation costs. Additionally, all participating resident artists will receive stipends for living expenses, creative materials, tools, and accommodation.
