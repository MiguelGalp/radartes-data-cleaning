This is a transitional terrain: part wildland, part badlands, rich with contrasts and resilience. Here, ecological boundaries are visible and felt — in the arid breath of the soil, the patterns of abandonment and regrowth, the erosional signatures etched into the land. Yet this is not a desert. It is a semi-arid ecotone where biodiversity and geological memory intersect, offering a raw and urgent context for creative exploration. Artists-in-residence engage not just with landscape, but with process: of restoration, of listening, of imagining alternatives to extraction and decline. Los Vélez is not merely backdrop — it is collaborator, archive, and provocation. At Joya: AiR, you are invited into dialogue with a territory at the threshold — where creative practice becomes an act of care, and the future of drylands is not yet written. ” joya: senda art in an ephemeral landscape joya: air environmental responsibility statement joya: air GCC / Gallery Climate Coalition active member 2023 Joya: AiR climate positive & off-grid since 2006 Joya: sustainable darkroom alternative & sustainable Joya: wild clay wood fired adobe ceramics kiln / spring 2023 Joya: studio playlists Featured May 23, 2025 Verano 25 May 23, 2025 May 23, 2025 May 23, 2025 studio mix #2: 2025 May 23, 2025 May 23, 2025 Nov 1, 2024 Joya: otoño 24 Nov 1, 2024 Nov 1, 2024 Jul 31, 2022 Joya: verano 22 Jul 31, 2022 Jul 31, 2022 Nov 6, 2020 Joya: lockdown playlist #6 Nov 6, 2020 Nov 6, 2020 join our mailing list sign up with your email address to receive news and updates First Name Last Name Email Address Sign Up we respect your privacy and will not inundate you with emails Thank you!
