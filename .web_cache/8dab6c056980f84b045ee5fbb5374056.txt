The AiR program is connected to a truly supportive and enthusiastic team, enabling me to feel both encouraged and equipped throughout my whole experience. There is also an active community of creatives throughout the city of Manchester too, and these connections, alongside those I made directly through the residency program offered me so much. Amira Hasoon, Fall 2022 ‚ÄúThe residency connections formed the conceptual basis for my final work, and created lasting professional relationships which will stretch out into the future. I have been in contact with ARMI about possible international projects in London and Seoul, and the article about my work in NH Magazine will be released sometime this month. In my experience, it is specifically these types of networking opportunities which further an artists' career.‚Äù Alexander Augustus, Winter 2022 "When I got into the studio apartment provided by the Factory Artist in Residence program, I was delighted about the space and the change of environment and grateful for the opportunity." "Manchester is a warm place. It‚Äôs full of people going on about their lives, striving for something better - you‚Äôll find this everywhere, but Manchester feels the most like this without pretence." Adeyemi Adebayo, Summer 2024 ‚ÄúBeing chosen to take part of the AiR program was a blessing!, I didn‚Äôt know how bad I needed to be immersed in my art. The opportunity led me to realize my true strengths and weaknesses. I learned how to stay true to myself and my artistry with every challenge that arose. I think every artist, sorely needs a program like this no matter what level in their career they‚Äôre in.‚Äù . Manny ‚ÄúPhelany‚Äù Ramirez,  Fall 2021 ‚ÄúThe Artist in Residence program at the Factory is truly one of transformation. The AiR team is fully supportive in each artists growth while maintaining the artist‚Äôs individual creative needs. I highly recommend this program for any creative that has the urge to purge their creativity without obstacles and feels the need to transcend their work to another level.‚Äù Cecilia Ulibarri, Fall 2021 ‚ÄúThe residency has allowed dedicated time and space to reconsider and push my practice forward. I have enjoyed visiting the Currier Museum and getting to know the arts community in Manchester.‚Äù Anthony Peyton, Summer 2021 ‚ÄúWe have been wanting to participate in a residency together ever since meeting each other in graduate school. I am grateful for this opportunity that allowed us to meaningfully converse and collaborate throughout our residency.‚Äù Julia Kown, Summer 2021 "It was a pleasure to have done this residency. Not only was it a perfect opportunity to develop my current work, but it also allowed me to take the time to meet creatives, visit historical locations, and learn about¬†different crafting practices that informed my making process.
