The theme proposes a multifaceted exploration of how civilizations—both ancient and contemporary—interact, evolve, and reshape artistic narratives. Artists are invited to reflect on pivotal historical moments, material culture, cross-cultural encounters, diasporic movement, and evolving traditions that have influenced the development of art across centuries. We ask participants to interrogate what is preserved and what is forgotten when civilizations engage in dialogue. How do power structures, migration, spirituality, innovation, and collective memory manifest in visual language? What can artists contribute to this critical inquiry in the 21st century? Through this call, RAK Art 2026 positions itself as a forum for critical thought and expressive experimentation. Artists working in any medium—whether painting, sculpture, installation, digital, or interdisciplinary formats—are encouraged to submit works that interrogate, reinterpret, or celebrate cultural interplay. Awards will be presented to the top two submissions in each category , with cash prizes and specially crafted trophies recognizing artistic excellence and intellectual engagement. We invite you to join us in this unique convergence of global perspectives where art becomes the vehicle for cultural reflection, shared learning, and aesthetic innovation.
