The Sculpture on Loan Program provides an opportunity for artists to prominently display their artwork in unique areas of the City for the public to enjoy. To further the community's goals related to art and culture, the City of Westminster has made significant investments in the both Historic Westminster and Downtown Westminster. These areas have received investments in park amenities, marketing, and community events. The City markets the areas through the delivery of events designed to attract both local and regional attention which include the Summer Block Party, Arts Week, Art a la Carte, local community artisan festivals, summer history tours, and monthly art walks. Artists wishing to have their sculpture(s) installed and displayed in these venues should review the following requirements and submit an application along with the requested supplemental materials. Up to fourteen sculptures will be selected for display during the 2025-2026 Sculpture on Loan Program. Artists may submit more than one application.
