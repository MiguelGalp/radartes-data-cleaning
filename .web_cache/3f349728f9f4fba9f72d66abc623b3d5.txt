Thirty finalists will be selected by this year’s Curators’ Circle – selected annually by CIRCA to uphold the integrity of the prize – to have their work screened throughout September on London’s iconic Piccadilly Lights and broadcast across the CIRCA global platform. CIRCA PRIZE invites submissions in response to REFUGIA — the 2025 manifesto from CIRCA. This year’s prize challenges artists to consider sanctuary not as retreat, but as resistance — inviting them to propose new ways of seeing, surviving, and shaping our collective future. Rooted in ideas of ecological rupture, forced migration, and collective memory, REFUGIA offers a poetic and political framework for reimagining public space in a time of planetary crisis.
