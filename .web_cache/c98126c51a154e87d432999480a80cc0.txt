This issue seeks to foreground critical explorations of themes such as matrilineage, rematriation, and interconnected transnational histories, particularly as they manifest in visual and performance-based work. In alignment with the museum’s broader curatorial and research programme, the special issue will highlight the work of artists who engage with embodied and inherited knowledge systems—especially those rooted in female and femme lineages—as vital sources of creative and cultural continuity.
