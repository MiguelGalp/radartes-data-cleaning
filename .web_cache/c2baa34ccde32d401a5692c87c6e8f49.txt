Aomori Contemporary Art Centre: Artist in Residence Programme 2025 (Japan) Call details Call details In-person mobility Open for: Individuals / Organisations & Collectives Artists, Curators Visual Arts & Design Destination countries: Japan Since its opening, Aomori Contemporary Art Centre (ACAC) has conducted an Artist in Residence (AIR) programme via open call nearly every year. This year’s open call AIR is intended to provide people involved in a wide range of cultural and artistic pursuits – including artists, curators, and researchers – with an opportunity to engage in creative activities while residing at ACAC. Residents will conduct research, create artwork, hold various events, and eventually present their results, while receiving continuous support from ACAC’s curators, technicians, and staff. The results – which may consist of artwork exhibitions, performances, workshops, presentations of research or production processes, or other formats – will be presented at this year’s presentation venue (14–29 November 2025). The residence period consists of a core period lasting for 52 days (51 nights) from 11 October to 1 December 2025, during which the participants will, in principle, reside at ACAC. If desired, participants may reside at ACAC for a maximum of 92 days (91 nights) from 15 September to 15 December 2025. This year, the title of the programme is ‘Camp’. In 2025, this same ‘Camp’ concept will also act as the framework for nomination-type AIR events, as well as for an additional AIR by an artist to be recommended by our international AIR partners. The organiser will cover travel expenses (up to 100,000 JPY for those residing in Japan, and 300,000 JPY for those residing overseas) , 300,000 JPY for production expenses, an honorarium for the sub-programme, studio space, accommodation and living expenses (172,590 JPY).
