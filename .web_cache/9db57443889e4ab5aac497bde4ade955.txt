Designed as a hybrid of academic inquiry, hands-on technical training, and artistic production, this fully supported programme offers a comprehensive framework for young artists to develop their creative voice within the rapidly evolving landscape of digital technologies. Developed in collaboration with the internationally renowned institution Le Fresnoy – Studio National des Arts Contemporains, the programme provides selected participants with exclusive access to state-of-the-art equipment, production studios, and professional mentorship. Artists are guided by esteemed international practitioners, theorists, and scholars who are leaders in their respective disciplines. Targeting emerging artists aged 35 and under, particularly those at the completion stage of graduate or postgraduate studies, the programme encourages exploration across a wide spectrum of media. Topics of investigation include, but are not limited to, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, sound art, experimental cinema, and digital archival practices. The programme culminates in a professionally curated public exhibition at DAF, showcasing the research and work developed throughout the year.
