We encourage you to capture the depth of the NOW - the moments that define and connect us. The unique lens of YOU, EVERYWHERE you go, capturing the essence of the NOW. YOU. EVERYWHERE. NOW. This is an open call for those who see the world as it is. Unfiltered. Unposed. Alive. We’re looking for more than just a mise-en-scène; we want to feel the impact of the moment. We want a story, woven by the threads of a place, people and emotion. An image capturing the deep yet flickering beauty of life around us. By entering this competition, you vow to slow down and open your lens to the pulse of an era rushing through you and everywhere around you. Join us. The fleeting is made eternal by YOU.
