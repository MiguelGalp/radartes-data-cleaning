Artist in Residence | Promoted RAi Residency 2025 Updated: 20 June 2025 The RAi Residency returns for its second edition — a 12-week programme designed to support artists, curators, and theorists in developing their practice within a studio environment. The residency offers a chance to connect, collaborate, and expand one’s oeuvre through engagement with local communities and institutions. RAi hosts four residents at a time: three artists and one curator or theorist. Eligibility: Emerging artists, curators, and theorists aged 25–40 working in the visual arts, including digital, traditional, new media, video, and photography. What you get: Residents receive a monthly stipend of €3,200. We provide studio space, networking opportunities, mentoring, social media support, publication features, exhibitions, and sales support. Jury members are yet to be finalised.
