THE PRIZE Prisma Art Prize is an art contest born to promote emerging painters and visual artists . As our name and logo suggests, we want to be a prism that refracts all the possible outcomes of the painting process. What we want is to answer a fundamental question in the current artistic context: what does painting mean today? At the base of our project, there is the constant and inclusive research and enhancement of artists from different cultural and educational backgrounds. OUR MISSION EXHIBITION VENUE CONTEMPORARY CLUSTER Creative forge in the heart of Rome, Contemporary Cluster dedicates its business to the contamination between disciplines, overcoming the traditional canons of art and moving towards an idea of total contemporaneity.
