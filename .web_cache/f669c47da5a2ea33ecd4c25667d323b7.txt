FN often has a deliberately emotional character and is often difficult to distinguish from real news. We focus here on the fake news against the transformation to sustainability, e.g. the energy transition. How do you debunk fake news? How do you set positive signals instead? We are planning an exhibition on the subject and are inviting artists from all over the world to submit their proposals. We would like to see works that take up this theme and conserve resources in terms of transportation and materials. We will jury them as a team and advertise them in print and online and show them in our rooms with an accompanying program such as an artist talk, specialist lecture and workshop. In a public call for entries, we invite artists to submit contributions for a group exhibition in our exhibition spaces on the theme described above.
