Online Exhibition: April 20 – May 20, 2025 Organized by: Whitelock Art Center, New York, USA Preface to "Chaos Code: 2025 New York International Art Competition": In today’s world, where globalization and digitalization intertwine, New York continues to be a cultural beacon, shining with infinite possibilities. "Chaos Code," as one of the key themes of Whitelock Art Center's 2025 New York International Art Competition, invites artists from around the globe to explore and challenge the delicate and complex relationship between humanity and technology. In this rapidly changing digital age, we are confronted with an unprecedented identity crisis. Chaos and order, freedom and control intertwine in artistic creation, reflecting the intricate landscape of human development in the future. "Chaos Code" is not just an exhibition theme but also a movement exploring the confrontational symbiosis between human intuition and AI-generated art. In an era dominated by digital code, algorithms seem omnipresent—from recommendation systems shaping our online behaviors to AI generating artworks. Every line of code is reshaping our understanding of "creation" and "self." Art is no longer merely a visual expression but a dynamic process of collision, interweaving, and reconstruction between human intellect and machine algorithms. The works in this exhibition will showcase how algorithms and human intuition clash, exploring new creative possibilities at the intersection of diverse cultural and technological boundaries. New York's contemporary art scene has always been known for its inclusivity, criticality, and avant-garde spirit. "Chaos Code" fully embodies these qualities. As an international platform, it not only showcases the creations of artists from different regions but also responds to pressing contemporary issues such as digital identity, artificial intelligence, post-humanism, environmental change, and cultural conflict in the context of globalization. Here, art is not merely an expression but a profound reflection on today’s society. Artists can use technological tools, such as AI generation, virtual reality, and gene editing, to challenge traditional paradigms of artistic creation, subverting conventional notions of art, identity, and self. They may also continue to employ traditional artistic techniques to depict emotionally resonant subjects. The curatorial team at Whitelock Art Center will focus this international competition on the multiple dimensions of the "future"—both as a vision of human lifestyles to come and a direct critique of current societal and technological transformations. From the bustling streets of New York to rural villages and the boundless virtual space of the internet, from the cold precision of AI-generated art to the delicate warmth of human emotion, each work will ask us: In this highly digitalized age, what does "human nature" mean? Can art, in the face of ever-advancing technology, maintain its core freedom and independence? "Chaos Code" is not only an art experiment but an invitation to dialogue and reflection. Through the unique language of art, the exhibited works will lead viewers into the digital fog, confronting the myriad possibilities of the future. In this diverse and challenging era, New York once again opens its arms, welcoming artists worldwide to submit their outstanding works and collectively explore the unsolved questions between humanity and technology. This is not only a prophecy for the future of art but also a profound diagnosis of the present. Here, art is no longer just an escape from reality; it is a courageous attempt to face the unknown and challenge fate. The competition will feature a diverse range of artistic forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, new media, collage, installation art, visual arts, digital art, AI technology and art, and multimedia.
