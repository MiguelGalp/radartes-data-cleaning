This programme reflects the vision that the association has grown over the years, by an accurate observation of the creative context within it operates. PimOff acts as collector and booster for emergent artists. The Citofonare PimOff call is addressed to Italian and international artists who present a contemporary dance project at its creation phase and that has never debuted. PimOff will provide a residency, up a maximum of 10 days, between February and April 2026. Whatever the stage of development of the project is, at the end of the residency, all companies/artists must present a preview/study to an audience of at least 30 minutes of the project and are asked to lead a training or laboratory activity open to the public.
