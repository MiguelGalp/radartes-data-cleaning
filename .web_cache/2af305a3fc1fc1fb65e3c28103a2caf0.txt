We finish review and notify applicants by early December. Applicants are evaluated by a review panel composed of our Co-Directors , Director of Artistic Programming , and professionals in the field. Residents are selected based on the quality of their work, commitment to their practice, and ability to engage with the community at large. Review Panel â Cost + Aid We offer our Summer Residency on a sliding scale, from $0â900. It costs us $5,000 per person to host the residency. Most of this is covered by the generous support of donors and grants, but we recommend a contribution of $900 per month per person from artists who are able to contribute. We also offer 10+ fellowships per year, which include a no-fee residency plus an honorarium.

The entire experience of community with artists and Wassaic Project staff, the barn, the mill, and proximity to nature was beyond fortifying on every level." â Kristi Keener 2022 Summer Resident Left to right: Kristi Keener, Lexy Ho-Tai, Maya Varadaraj, Nicole Banowetz "Somehow it still feels radical to be both an artist and a mother. My family is loud, we take up space, we have time constraints and schedules. We donât fit with most art spaces, which is why I will forever sing the praises of the Wassaic Project for welcoming me as an artist with a family. Iâm still practicing shaking off the stigmas.â Jordan Buschur 2022 Family Resident Jordan Buschur and family "I want to share my sincere thanks for a wonderful, productive, and stimulating residency this summer! It was such a joy to spend two months at Wassaic. This residency stirred up so many new possibilities, ideas, and potentials. I'll be squeezing the juice out of this experience for many months to come.â Lauren Ruth 2022 Summer Resident Lauren Ruth "I had a great time. I would have stayed longer if it were feasible. Everyone from the staff to the residents were very supportive and was open to any idea that I brought to them. Wassaic Project is truly an open space that will find a way to see your vision come to light." Ryan Davis 2022 Summer Resident Ryan Davis [The residency] had a very positive and profound impact on me at a time when I really needed some intense studio/sanctuary time away from my usual routine/environment to shake up, regroup, and process some new ideas. So greatly appreciated, and looking forward to future opportunities to return/collaborate with you all. Michael Hambouz 2022 Summer Resident Michael Hambouz "My whole life has changed so much thanks to all of you. New friends, new shows, invitation to Italy, etc... I'm so totally grateful to everyone." Rachel Collier 2021â2022 Winter Resident Rachel Collier "Wassaic Project is a wonderful, community-minded residency with staff providing support that is above and beyond. As a family resident, the shorter 2-week residency allowed me a manageable amount of time away to solely focus on my practice. I was able to delve into the research and develop concepts around a new body of work, while also exploring the ample local flora to create inks and dyes to use in the studio."
