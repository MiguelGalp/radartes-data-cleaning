The David C. Driskell Center at the University of Maryland invites applications for its 2025–2026 Archives Research Fellowship program. Designed to support original scholarship rooted in the Center’s rich archival holdings, the program offers two low-residency fellowships over the academic year. Each fellow will receive a $3,000 stipend, paid in two installments, along with travel and lodging support for a short-term residency of up to three weeks at the Center. Applications from scholars, artists, and cultural workers whose work engages with Black art, art history, and visual culture are welcomed. About The Archives The Driskell Center Archives houses a growing collection of primary source materials across thirteen distinct collections documenting the lives, work, and critical reception of African American artists, scholars, and cultural institutions. Notable holdings include the personal papers of artist and scholar David C. Driskell—featuring six decades of correspondence, lectures, exhibition planning documents, and ephemera—as well as archives from the Weusi Artist Collective, artists Alonzo Davis and robin holder, art historians Tritobia Hayes Benjamin and Michael D. Harris, and arts administrator Terrie Rouse-Rosario. The Center’s archives contain correspondence, photographs, audiovisual materials, press clippings, and ephemera related to the history of Black art. The Center also maintains a non-circulating research library of over 5,000 volumes, including many rare exhibition catalogs. Together with its permanent collection of artworks, these resources support interdisciplinary research in art history, African American studies, visual culture, and museum studies. Applicants are encouraged to consult the Driskell Center’s website for finding aids and additional information, or to contact staff with specific questions about the holdings. Eligibility The fellowship is open to scholars, artists, curators, and cultural workers at any career stage, including graduate students (ABD), early-career researchers, and independent scholars. Applicants must demonstrate a clear research interest in African American art and visual culture, with a specific plan for using the archival and/or special collections of The Driskell Center. While the fellowship is open to U.S. and international applicants, travel reimbursement is limited to domestic travel within the United States. Commitment Fellows are expected to complete a short-term research residency at The Driskell Center (up to three weeks) during the 2025–2026 academic year. The timing of the residency will be scheduled in coordination with the Center staff. Fellows will be asked to share their research in a public-facing format, such as a virtual presentation, blog post, or interview. A stipend of $3,000 will be paid in two installments: the first upon commencement of the fellowship on September 2, 2025, and the second upon completion of the residency and submission of a summary report by June 30, 2026.
