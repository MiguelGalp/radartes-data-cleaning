Jones is one of the most fearless artists working in the U.S. today. With a body of work that defies neat categorization, Jones’ multifaceted career has encompassed collaborations with visual artists, international commissions and Broadway productions, as well as a rich repertory for his own company. Jones’ work is often rooted in personal experience and speaks authentically to many across a spectrum of communities. The Jerome Robbins Dance Division acquired the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company Records in 2017. We now invite applications for the Dance Research Fellowship from dance scholars and practitioners interested in exploring the legacy and ongoing work of Jones.
