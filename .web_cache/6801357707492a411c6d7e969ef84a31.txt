Inspired by the historic Parisian Salon organized under the auspices of the Académie des Beaux-Arts, this modern counterpart unfolds entirely online in a dynamic, year-round format. Twelve standalone monthly contests feed into a grand, cumulative championship: the Annual PleinAir Salon Art Competition. By turning the traditional exhibition model into a rolling series of juried events, the Salon keeps artists continuously motivated, challenged, and visible to a global audience. The stakes are tangible and substantial. Throughout the calendar year, the Salon distributes an impressive total of $50,000 in cash awards , ensuring that creative achievement is rewarded not just with applause but with meaningful financial support. The highest-scoring artwork claims the coveted cover of PleinAir magazine, granting the winner unparalleled exposure to collectors, galleries, and fellow painters. Every monthly cycle crowns its own roster of category and overall champions. Those artists pocket cash prizes, appear in feature write-ups across PleinAir ’s print edition, receive spotlight placements in its widely read e-newsletters, and benefit from amplified reach on the magazine’s website and social-media platforms. All monthly gold-medalists automatically advance to the annual finals. The climactic moment arrives at the Plein Air Convention & Expo each May—in 2024 it will be the 13th Annual Awards Ceremony—where the Grand Prize winner will step onstage to accept a $15,000 check and the acclaim of peers assembled from around the world.
