Session: 3rd January – 28st January 2026 Session: 3rd February – 28th February 2026 Farm Studio International Artist Residency is located in a rural community in India. Residents stay and create in a quiet art centre and beautiful environment where they can develop their artwork free from accustomed distractions. Farm Studio residency provides three types of working spaces where artists can explore their art and ideas in the rural Rajasthani environment; at the Farm Studio indoor studios, the outdoor desert and farm environments, and in Andore Village. Here, collaboration and experimentation is encouraged. Relationships form between the artists coming from different countries and varied social, cultural, and artistic backgrounds. Many exciting exchanges and dialogues among artists take place, including scheduled artist talks, presentations, works in progress showings, etc. Farm Studio also promotes and celebrates the local community’s artistic and cultural identity while also introducing art and culture of others’ (Indian and International guests) back to the community. This intercultural exchange broadens everyone’s experiences and fosters art appreciation. Eligibility Rewards Does this sound like something for you?
