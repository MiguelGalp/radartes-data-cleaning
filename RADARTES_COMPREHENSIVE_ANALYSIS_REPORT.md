## CONCLUSION

RADARTES demonstrates its value as both a practical platform for individual artists and a strategic intelligence tool for cultural development. While the platform successfully aggregates diverse opportunities across 57 countries, our analysis reveals significant structural patterns in international cultural funding that require strategic consideration.

The data confirms that Latin American artists have substantial access to opportunities, but reveals that true international funding is concentrated in European institutions, particularly Spanish ones. This presents both opportunities for strategic engagement and challenges for regional cultural independence.

*This analysis provides the foundation for informed decision-making at both individual artist and institutional policy levels, supporting the development of Latin American cultural capacity in the global context.*
